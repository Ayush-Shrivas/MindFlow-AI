**MindFlow AI** is an intent-understanding system that transforms unstructured human thoughts into structured intelligence.  
It analyzes goals, emotions, constraints, and uncertainties from natural language input and converts them into **visual intent graphs**, enabling context-aware reasoning, smarter decisions, and future-ready AI automation.

## 🚀 Why MindFlow AI?

Most AI systems respond to **commands**.  
MindFlow AI understands **intent before execution**.

Humans often express ideas vaguely:

> *“I want to do something meaningful in tech but avoid burnout.”*

MindFlow AI structures this ambiguity into a clear, actionable representation instead of generic responses.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Intent Extraction**
  - Identifies goals, emotions, constraints, and unknowns from free-text input
- **Intent Graph Generation**
  - Converts abstract thoughts into structured nodes and relationships
- **AI-Powered Reasoning**
  - Uses Google Gemini for deep semantic understanding
- **Extensible Architecture**
  - Designed as a cognitive layer for future AI agents and tools
- **Human-Centered Intelligence**
  - Focuses on *why* before *what*

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

| Category        | Technology |
|----------------|-----------|
| **Frontend**   | React, Vite, TypeScript |
| **Backend**    | Node.js, Express.js |
| **AI Layer**   | Google Gemini API |
| **Tools**      | Git, npm |

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User enters a natural language thought
2. AI extracts:
   - Core goal
   - Emotional context
   - Constraints
   - Unknowns
3. Extracted data is converted into an **Intent Graph**
4. Frontend visualizes the graph
5. Graph enables better reasoning, planning, and automation
